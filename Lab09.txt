	a. How many API endpoints does this application support and where are they implemented?
	   There is 1 API endpoint
	b. i. What is the Java-based technology used to access data from a database?
	      JDBC statements
	   ii. Compare and contrast the following:
	   		1. SQL query statements vs. JDBC statement objects
			    The statment object needs to return as a list of rows but
				an SQL query returns a new table. 
			2. SQL relations vs. JDBC result sets vs. List<Player>
			    SQL relations vs. JDBC result sets vs. List<Player>
				SQL relations are a table format holding tuples of information
				correlated to each unique identifier (primary key). The JDBC 
				result set is an object that stores a list(?) of returned
				information. List<Player> would be an example of a list
				containing objects.
	  iii. Under what circumstances would the function getValueStringOrNull() be used?
  		   getValueStringOrNull() would be used whenever the user wants display something that is could potentially be NULL.
  	       In PlayerResource.java it's  being used to retrieve and display the player's name. 
c.Player.java
    i.What purpose does this Player DAO serve?
    Provides an object-oriented way to represent and manipulate player "objects"
    from the traditional (non-object-oriented) Monopoly base.
    ii. How does it compare with the Player table?
    In the player table we don't have any methods. Rather, we use queries to get
    the data. Player DAO serve does have different methods that can be implemented
    in a object-oriented fashion.
