a. The KnightRanker Trello board indicates to me that everyone made contributions recently and the work seems well rounded 
for each member. Joe does seem to have been picking up a bit more coding work than others, but I noticed that he did not 
participate in the presentation so they did well balancing out responsibilities.
b. I liked their presentation and I thought they did improve from the initial presentation. It seemed like they
took into account suggestions that people had made both at the previous presentation and their user tests, even if 
it was just prospects for future development and not yet implemented. I thought the app itself looked a lot better and
I liked that they demonstrated an example of communication between two competitors via the app. It was connected to their
database and functioned effectively. They even found a legitimate purpose for the color picker. It was overall a compelling
presentation and I think a promising application.
c. Although it is still a bit buggy, as most of our apps are, it is at a generally functional phase and is comprehensive.
I think I would like to see a more interesting home page rather than everything shoved onto the side nav, but that's mostly
a personal preference. They demonstrated a help popup which was good.
